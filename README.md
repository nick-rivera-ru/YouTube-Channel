# YouTube-Channel

In my YouTube channel I have a multitude of videos that help aspiring analysts how to perform ETL operations on their data.

This channel is free to anyone who would like the help. My goal is only the help and inspire those that are having trouble figuring out certain concepts. 
I'm open to video ideas, so if you have a topic you'd like some help on don't hesitate to shoot me a message!
